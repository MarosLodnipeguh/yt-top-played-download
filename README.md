## TODO / Future improvements:
- Java executable for Windows
- console logs pass to the GUI, non-blocking, currently the GUI freezes during the download process
- [ ] add a progress bar for the download process
- Threaded downloading process
- Show artists in the list
- Lazy background image loading, with a blurry placeholder for the list view (non-blocking for the UI)
- Charts for the top artists, top genres, etc. (in a separate tab)
- Audio downloader with trimmer using ffmpeg (in a separate tab, basically a GUI for yt-dlp with trimming capabilities)
- auto updater for yt-dlp.exe
